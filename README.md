## Hi fellow students and Professors!
I'm a student in the ðŸ”±Arizona State UniversityðŸ”± GIT program learning design and full stack web development.  I'm currently a Scrum Master for a large financial firm and want to learn more about web development.  I hope to eventually transition into a developer role.  I have always wanted to do more with software development.  When it's not 100+ degrees out I am usually riding my motorcycle, working in the garden or traveling with my wife.

I can be reached at brianhusk@gmail.com
